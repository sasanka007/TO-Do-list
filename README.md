# TO-Do-list
A simple yet effective to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing them with the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks.

Functionality:

Adding Tasks:
Users can add new tasks to the to-do list by entering a task description into the input field provided. Upon submitting the form, the task is dynamically added to the list, complete with buttons for editing, marking as done, and removing the task.

Displaying Date and Time:
The application displays the current date and time at the top of the interface. This provides users with a sense of context and helps them track their tasks more effectively.

Dynamic Styling and Layout:
The application employs CSS styling to create an attractive and responsive layout. Flexbox is used to arrange elements in a visually pleasing manner, ensuring that the user interface adapts to different screen sizes.

Editing Tasks:
Users can edit tasks by clicking on the "Edit" button associated with each task. This action triggers the appearance of an edit form, pre-filled with the current task description. Once the user submits the edited content, the task is updated with the new description.

Marking Tasks as Done:
Clicking on the "Done" button for a task visually indicates that the task has been completed. The application toggles a "done" class on the task, which visually strikes through the task text and gives it a green background.

Removing Tasks:
Users can remove tasks from the to-do list by clicking on the "Remove" button associated with each task. This action instantly removes the task from the list, helping users maintain a clutter-free task list.

User-friendly Interaction:
The application offers user-friendly interactions through hover effects on buttons. Buttons change color and appearance when hovered over, providing visual feedback to users.

Real-time Updates:
The application utilizes JavaScript to provide real-time updates. For instance, the current time is displayed at the top, which updates every half-second. Also, editing and removing tasks dynamically update the task list without the need for a page reload.
